                    <h1>BUILD A COMPLETE COMPANY WEBSITE USING HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT</h1>
                    <h2>How To Begin:</h2>
                    <h3>Imagine building a beautiful and interactive house, 
                        but instead of bricks and mortar, you use code! That's the magic of frontend websites. 
                        With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you'll be the architect and interior designer, 
                        crafting the visual elements, layout, and even some of the special effects users see 
                        and interact with.  Think of HTML as the foundation, CSS the paint and furniture, 
                        and JavaScript the smart-home features that make things move and respond. 
                        It's all about bringing websites to life, making them user-friendly and engaging
                         for everyone who visits!</h3>
                         <br>
                         <ul>
           <li>Download and install VS code from your browser</li>
            <li>Create a new folder in your computer</li>
               <li>Open the new folder you created with VS code, then create a new file within your VS code editor
                 and name in index.html.  </li>
                 <li>The index.html  file will contain code for the html structure of our website.</li>
                <li>Create a new file again in within your VS code and name it style.css.</li>
                 <li>The style.css file will contain codes for the css styling our website.</li>
               <p> Let's exit the VS code or minimize it, then we come back to our folder, 
                then within our folder, we will create another folder and name it images, 
                then store or paste the images you would like to use while we create our website.
                 It could be images of products and company environment pictures, 
                 if you would like your website to be about a company and the services you offer. 
                 It could be a school and it's facilities pictures.
                </p>
                <p>Below, we have our index.html file, as well as style.css file,
                    also we have another folder and in there we can see a folder that was 
                    created in which there are various images and logo being displayed, which will
                    be used for our website.

            <h1>HTML: "Hypertext Markup Language"</h1>
            <p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of creating
             web pages. It's like the skeleton that provides structure and organization to the content 
             you see on a website. HTML doesn't define the visual style of the webpage. It focuses 
             on the content itself. You can use HTML to write text, insert images and videos, 
             and create tables to organize information.Hypertext refers to the ability to link between web pages. 
             HTML allows you to create hyperlinks, which is essentially text you can click on to navigate
              to another webpage. This is what makes the web an interconnected web of information.
             HTML works alongside other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to 
             create a complete web page. CSS is responsible for the visual design, like fonts and colors, 
             and JavaScript adds interactivity to webpages.</p>
             <br>
             <h4>Here's a breakdown of what HTML does:</h4>
             <ul>
                <li>Structure: HTML defines different parts of a webpage, like headings, paragraphs, images, and lists. 
                It uses tags, which are special keywords wrapped in angle brackets (< and >), 
                to tell the web browser how to display the content. For instance, the tag h1 indicates a heading,
                 while the p tag signifies a paragraph.</li>
                 <li>Content:  HTML doesn't define the visual style of the webpage. It focuses on the content itself.
                     You can use HTML to write text, insert images and videos, 
                     and create tables to organize information.</li>
                <li>Hypertext:  Hypertext refers to the ability to link between web pages. HTML allows you to create 
                    hyperlinks, which is essentially text you can click on to navigate to another webpage. 
                    This is what makes the web an interconnected web of information.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>HTML works alongside other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to 
                    create a complete web page. CSS is responsible for the visual design, like fonts and colors,

            <h4>Now, let's get started. We will open our index.html file now with our code editor</h4>
            <br>
                <div class="RRow">
            <div class="Responsive-col">
                <h4>Here, we start with the basic html structures:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The DOCTYPE declaration, which is essentially the first line in an HTML document.
                         It tells the web browser that this is an HTML document 
                         and what version of HTML it's written in.
                        </li>
                    <li>The html tag marks the beginning of the HTML document itself. Everything 
                        between the opening html tag and the closing html tag 
                        defines the content of the webpage.</li>
                    <li>The head tag defines the head section of the document. The head section contains 
                        meta information about the webpage that isn't directly displayed on the page 
                        itself but is still important for browsers and search engines.
                        </li>
                    <li>The meta tag that provides instructions on how to control the viewport of the webpage.
                         </li>
                    <li>The title tag defines the title of the webpage. The title is displayed on the browser tab
                         and search engine results. In this case, the title is set to 
                         "Technology Website".</li>
                    <li> The link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" tag links the external stylesheet file named 
                        "style.css" to the HTML document. By linking an external stylesheet, you can keep the 
                        HTML code clean and organized.</li>

                Let's open our webpage with a web browser, here we opened it with Firefox. 
                We opened our folder again and clicked on the index.html file, right click then open

                                   of this tutorial. Then we have the div which serves as a container that carries our html tags.

        Click or Open the "Google Fonts" website. (fonts.google.com).
        After opening the page, on this page we can see several written words in different sizes and boldness, and here we can search the font by their name. Let us select the one with the title poppins and we can see several level of boldness of each text. 
        We will click on poppins and then select which font we want to use, we can click on the extra light, light, bold, regular, e.t.c.  Then we click on the (+) icon beside the style we want to select, then we can add, this will enable use see the code snippet for embedding the font.
        1. Choose a Font on Google Fonts:
        •	Head over to Google Fonts.
        •	Browse the library and select the font you want to use on your webpage.
        2. Select Font Styles and Generate Code (Optional):
        •	Once you've chosen a font, click on it to see the available styles (like regular, italic, bold).
        •	You can pick specific styles or select them all.
        •	Click the "+" icon next to "Select styles" to see the code snippet for embedding the font.
        Then in the right side of the screen or below the screen, depending, we can see the code snippet or code link for embedding the font, based on the style we have previously selected. So, we copy the code snippet for embedding the font.

    <p>Now, let's add the google font in the css. Again, we go back to the same website

        Now, That means in our header section, we have added all the content.
        Let's open this page in a smaller screen so that we can see what it looks like.
        Right now, we can see it is not looking good for the small screen.
        For us to check our page on a smaller screen, we click on the settings option, 
        we can see the three lines at the right hand side of our firefox browser. 
        For google chrome browser, we can right click and select more tools and click on responsive design mode.
        So, on our firefox browser we click on the three lines at the right hand side 
        of the webpage on our computer screen which includes the settings aspect, we scroll down and 
        click on more tools and then click on responsive design mode. This will bring out the smaller screen.

<p>Opening the smaller screen right now, the page we are creating is not looking good on the smaller 
    screen devices, we have to correct it. For that, we will use the "media query" in our CSS file.  
    In our CSS file, we will write:
    @media (max-width: 700px){} --------->  then whatever code we will write in this media query,
     will be applicable for the device whose width is less than or equal to 700pixel.
    </p>
    <div class="RRow">
        <div class="Responsive-col">
            <p>So, let's come to our CSS file and continue, in our next line. We will write::</p>

                <p>Refresh the website, and we can see that the font-size is looking perfect for the smaller screen.
                    Next, we will collect the menu for this website.
                    
                    We will come back to the CSS file again and let's scroll up and see where we have 
                    written the CSS for the menu which is the ".nav-links ul li". So, let's write it in our
                     media query and add display to be block.
                    For better understanding, here is the media query again, along with the navigation
                     and its properties.

            <p>After  this, we can see on our browser  how the menu has appeared on the smaller screen.
                 But right now, the menu is opened so we have to add the icon, which will be used to 
                 close and open the menu.</p>

    <div class="Responsive-col">
        <p>We can as well see that the menu is hidden for the full screen device and it is only 
            visible for the small screen. So to add one icon, we will come to our browser and search 
            for "font awesome 4 cdn"
            Open the website and then we will see a cdn link like this:
            link rel = "stylesheet” href = "htpps://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/
            font-awesome.min.css"
            We will copy the cdn link from the website then come to the html file in the head tag and paste. 
            Now showing the head tag again for better understanding, our head tag currently look like this:
            </p>
    </div>
    <div class="RRow">

            <img src="images/Screenshot (393).png">

    <div class="Responsive-col">
    <p>Showcased the head tag again for better understanding, and we see how the head tag currently looks.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="Responsive-col">
       <p>After adding the cdn link, we will come to the browser again and search for "font awesome 4 icons."
         Open the website and search for the icons that we want to use, so here I will scroll to the search bar
          and type "close". Here we can see icon named as times. Let's click on the third one. Click and open,
           we have the name "fa-times" scroll down and copy the one line of code which looks like this:
        i class = "fa   fa-times"
       We will remove the "aria-hidden = "true" in order to make it look simple.
       We  come back to our html file, then paste it where we want to display the icon in our html file. 
       We  will add the closing icon before the "ul" tag.
       </p> 
       <br>
       <p>Next, we will add another icon, so again, we will come to the font awesome icons search bar 
        and type "menu". We will see the icon menu bar and open the first one. We have the name "fa-bars" here,
         we will scroll down and copy the one line of code where we have:
        i class = "fa  fa-bars" we will remove the "aria-hidden = "true" as well.
        So now, we will come back to our html file, and paste it before the closing nav tag.
        Now we have added two icons like this:

<div class="Responsive-col">
    <p>Now, let's refresh our webpage.  We can see the closing icon on our webpage on 
        the smaller screen. If we open the webpage in full size, we can see the two icons
         as well. So we have to hide the icon from the full screen webpage because it will 
         be only visible for the smaller screen.</p>

<div class="Responsive-col">
    <p>We will come back to the css file and then, we write our code before the media query.
         Which means we will be writing our code outside of the media query.</p>
</div>
<div class="RRow">
    <div class="Responsive-col">
        <p>We write the  nav tag with the icon class name and css property</p>

    <p>Now, the icon will be hidden for the larger screen devices
         and also, in the smaller screen, we can see the icon is hidden. 
         We have to add the icon for the smaller screen. We will come back to the css 
         file again and in the media query, after the curly closing bracket for 
         class name nav-links in the media query,we will add:</p>

                    <h2>How To Begin:</h2>
                    <h3>Imagine building a beautiful and interactive house, 
                        but instead of bricks and mortar, you use code! That's the magic of frontend websites. 
                        With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you'll be the architect and interior designer, 
                        crafting the visual elements, layout, and even some of the special effects users see 
                        and interact with.  Think of HTML as the foundation, CSS the paint and furniture, 
                        and JavaScript the smart-home features that make things move and respond. 
                        It's all about bringing websites to life, making them user-friendly and engaging
                         for everyone who visits!</h3>

            <h1>HTML: "Hypertext Markup Language"</h1>
            <p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of creating
             web pages. It's like the skeleton that provides structure and organization to the content 
             you see on a website. HTML doesn't define the visual style of the webpage. It focuses 
             on the content itself. You can use HTML to write text, insert images and videos, 
             and create tables to organize information.Hypertext refers to the ability to link between web pages. 
             HTML allows you to create hyperlinks, which is essentially text you can click on to navigate
              to another webpage. This is what makes the web an interconnected web of information.
             HTML works alongside other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to 
             create a complete web page. CSS is responsible for the visual design, like fonts and colors, 
             and JavaScript adds interactivity to webpages.</p>
             <br>
             <h4>Here's a breakdown of what HTML does:</h4>
             <ul>
                <li>Structure: HTML defines different parts of a webpage, like headings, paragraphs, images, and lists. 
                It uses tags, which are special keywords wrapped in angle brackets (< and >), 
                to tell the web browser how to display the content. For instance, the tag h1 indicates a heading,
                 while the p tag signifies a paragraph.</li>
                 <li>Content:  HTML doesn't define the visual style of the webpage. It focuses on the content itself.
                     You can use HTML to write text, insert images and videos, 
                     and create tables to organize information.</li>
                <li>Hypertext:  Hypertext refers to the ability to link between web pages. HTML allows you to create 
                    hyperlinks, which is essentially text you can click on to navigate to another webpage. 
                    This is what makes the web an interconnected web of information.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>HTML works alongside other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to 
                    create a complete web page. CSS is responsible for the visual design, like fonts and colors, 
                    and JavaScript adds interactivity to webpages</p>
                    <br>
            <h4>Now, let's get started. We will open our index.html file now with our code editor</h4>
            <br>
                <div class="RRow">
            <div class="Responsive-col">
                <h4>Here, we start with the basic html structures:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The DOCTYPE declaration, which is essentially the first line in an HTML document.
                         It tells the web browser that this is an HTML document 
                         and what version of HTML it's written in.
                        </li>
                    <li>The html tag marks the beginning of the HTML document itself. Everything 
                        between the opening html tag and the closing html tag 
                        defines the content of the webpage.</li>
                    <li>The head tag defines the head section of the document. The head section contains 
                        meta information about the webpage that isn't directly displayed on the page 
                        itself but is still important for browsers and search engines.
                        </li>
                    <li>The meta tag that provides instructions on how to control the viewport of the webpage.
                         </li>
                    <li>The title tag defines the title of the webpage. The title is displayed on the browser tab
                         and search engine results. In this case, the title is set to 
                         "Technology Website".</li>
                    <li> The link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" tag links the external stylesheet file named 
                        "style.css" to the HTML document. By linking an external stylesheet, you can keep the 
                        HTML code clean and organized.</li>

            <p>In the html file, we have added the link tag, that will connect the html and css fille which is
                link rel = “stylesheet”  href = “style.css”
               Next, we will add the code in the body tag that will be displayed on our webpage.

                          add some more properties to it.</p>

            <p>Now we have to add the animation for the text. In our css file, let's scroll back to the
                 class name back-text with span and include more properties:</p>
        <div class="RRow">
         <div class="Responsive-col">
         <p>Like this in CSS:</p>

        </div>
        </div>
        <p>So with transform set as translateY(100px) the text will be moved down by 100px. 
            Then with transition set as transform 1s the text will take 1s to move the text up.</p>
        <div class="RResponsive-col">
         <img src="images/Screenshot (496).png">
        </div>
        <div class="Responsive-col">
        <p>Here, for the text to move up whenever we refresh the website, we will come to our css file after
             the closing curly bracket for class name back-text with span, we will write:</p>
             </div>
             <div class="RRow">
            <div class="Responsive-col">

            </div>
            <div class="Responsive-col">
            <p>By adding the active class properties, the text will be moved back to it's original 
                position again, but we have to enable the active class using JavaScript.
             Let's come back to our html file, we will come above the closing body tag and add the 
                    script tag, then within the script tag, we will write:
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="Responsive-col">

            <div class="Responsive-col">
            <p>So we have script</p>
            </div>
            </div>
            <div class="Responsive-col">
            <p>In this script, we have written:
            Let spanTexts = document.getElementByTagName------ > at the front, we have the span 
            in a bracket which is the TagName which will store all the characters of offer like an array.
             We have also written window.onload, so whenever we reload the window the function will be executed.
            We have written for loop which includes spanText of spanTexts ,
             where we added spanText.classList.add----- > at the front of it we have active class in a bracket.
            This will add the active class from the css file for each span in our html file one by one.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Refresh the website and we can see that the offer text is moving up and all the character of the text 
                is moving at the same time, so we have to add some time delay.</p>
